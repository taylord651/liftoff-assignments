## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Which high school did you attend? At first glance, this question seems innocent, but it is often used to stereotype a person based on their school and neighborhood. The school you attend is often determined by the home in which your family lives. The location of your home is often determined by your family’s income. Your family’s income is determined by the education of your parents, and your parent’s education is often determined by the school they attend. Receiving a rigorous and quality education is a key to breaking free of this continuous cycle. 

What if we made it easier for families to research various high schools in an effort to find the best school for their student rather than blindly relying on the neighborhood schools? My project will allow users to find general information about various high schools in the St. Louis community in one place. Initially this project will focus on the St. Louis Public School district and private schools throughout the St. Louis region. It will also match families with high schools that best meet their needs. This project is inspired by my current job, which involves helping families find and apply to the best high school for their family. I have spent the past three years researching schools, visiting them in person and helping families with the application process.
